# Hangman
An​ interactive​ game​ created​ for​ entertainment ​ ​purposes​ using HTML, CSS,​ Javascript​ & jQuery. ​ ​Hangman​ follows​ the​ concept​ of the​ original ​ ​game​ Hangman,​ with​ users​ guessing​ basketball​ teams. This was my first individul app created after learning how to use JavaScript through a Udemy course after graduating from a bootcamp. It was great to work on a project as an individual, after creating this project I realized how much more I love and feel comfortable with JavaScript compared to Ruby On Rails. This project is what steered me towards learning more JavaScript, Node.js and React.js. It was a fun project to create and show friends and family the skills that I have, also a fun game to play when I'm bored.
